     About the Class
     </h2>

     <h3>
     This class is one of my favorites that I'm taking this semester and the reason this site exists.
     This year we've made page layouts using InDesign, learned about photographic composition and took photos, made a video report and learned about script writing as well as recording and editing video.
     The unit we are currently on is about web presence. In this unit we are working with html making websites such as this one.
     The page layout and video projects were group projects. This class along has made me much more comfortable with group work.
     In the past, I disliked any group work because I wasn't good at speaking up and often worried about my group members not working as hard as I did.
     I am now fine with giving my thoughts and input to my group and I have confidence that they'll will do a good job.
     I love hands on learning, and this class is exactly that.
     I would have trouble actually learning and understanding if I didn't do what I'm learning about myself, so I like that the class is set up this way.

     About the Teacher
     <h2>

     <h3>
     Dr. Carlos Evia is an excellent teacher, and I'm not just saying that because he'll be seeing this.
     My favorite kind of teachers are the ones who aren't super serious but are still serious about their students learning. Dr. Evia is exactly this.
     He often makes jokes and says funny things during class, but when someone has a serious question, he makes effort to make sure they understand.
     I can tell he cares about his students understanding of the topics, not just enough so that they complete the assignments he gives, but enough that they'll be able to use the skills learned in the future during their career.
