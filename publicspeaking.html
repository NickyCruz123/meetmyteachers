     About the Class
     </h2>
<h3>
     In this class we give speeches. So far this year we've given a narrative speech, a concept speech, a progress report, and an issue analysis.
     The last speech will be group persuasive speech done with our critique groups. One thing I like about this class is that it is half online.
     The whole class is split into two groups, orange and maroon. On the days that one group is giving their speeches, the other group gets to stay home and work on their upcoming speech or do an online quiz.
     I started the year out pretty anxious about public speaking but this class has helped me a lot, not only in helping me become less anxious while presenting, but also helping me improve my skills.

     About the Teacher
   </h2>

<h3>
     Jenna Davis has been a great teacher this semester. She is very approachable and friendly to all of the students.
     After people give a speech she'll sometimes talk to them about the topic because she knows it's something they are interested in.
     For example, when I gave my progress report about an art showcase my LLC was doing, she asked me about it afterwards so she could come to it.
     She is one of the youngest teachers I've had. While some people may think that younger teachers are worse because they lack experience, I enjoy having someone who has recently been in the same place I'm in and understands what it's like to be a college student.
