     About the Class
     </h2>

     <p>
     While I usually don't have the best time with history classes, this class has been fun and interesting.
     In this class we learn about clothing and fashion people have worn over the years.
     We began with the ancient world, looking at places such as ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome.
     We then learned about the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo fashions, 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, the Romantic period, the Crinoline period, the Bustle period, and World War I and II.
     Currently, students are giving presentations about famous designers assigned to them. I already gave mine which was about Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana.
     After presentations are done, we will learn about the 60s and all decades up to the 2000s, which I am very excited about.
     I think it important to learn about historical clothing and what people wore in the past as a fashion major because trends tend to come back, and it should be known where they come from.

     <h2>
     About the Teacher
   </h2>

     <p>I've had Dr. LuAnn Gaskill for two other courses before this one, introduction to AHRM and clothing and people.
     Clothing and people was similar to this class. We learned about clothing people wore around the world in different cultures.
     Because I had a similar class taught by the same person, I knew what this class would be like.
     Dr. Gaskill has a powerpoint she goes over in class, but doesn't always go over everything that will be on the test, so reading the textbook is very important.
     She is a very interesting person who has traveled a lot and has many stories that I love hearing.</p>
