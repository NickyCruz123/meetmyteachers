     About the Class
     </h2>

     <h3>
     This is a online class for students transferring into or adding a communication major. I took a similar course, Intro to AHRM, during my first semester at Virginia Tech.
     I was expecting this class to be similar to that one because they are both introduction classes for a major, the only difference being this one being online. However, this was far from the only difference.
     In this course, we have a lot of assignments that prepare us for a career in communication. For example, we've made resumes and compiled lists about communication resources and organizations.
     This course also serves as a way to plan the remaining classes I will take before I graduate.
     There have been assignments to meet with the instructor, both in groups and individually, and talk about and check what classes remain and if we have enough credits.
     This course had eased a lot of stress I've had about adding another major, and was also the reason I switched from a double major to a dual degree.

     About the Teacher
     <h2>

     <h3>
     While I haven't seen Ms. Susan C. Stinson, who goes by Scout, much face to face due to the class being online, I can tell she is a great instructor and advisor.
     The assignments she gives are helpful not only now, but will be helpful for my future career. She even gives assignments to post about what we want to do in the future, showing that she cares.
     When I've met with her face to face in her office, she was very welcoming and kind.
     She informed me that I should change my double major to a dual degree due to the amount of credits I'm taking because it would keep me from being charged as an out of state student.
     This information will save me a lot of money and I'm very thankful she told me.
     Another thing that I enjoy about Scout is that in her emails and Canvas posts she uses emoticons such as ":0)". While this is a small detail, it always brings a smile to my face.
