     <h2>
     About the Class
     </h2>

     <h3>
     In this class we learn about how popular culture affects our lives. I've never had a class quite like this one.
     Every day I'm in this class, it makes me thinks about things I've never thought much about before and how it affects my life.
     Some examples of popular culture we've talked about include Gilmore Girls, Seinfeld, and Hannah Montana.
     We talk about the definitions of popular culture including it being a culture of the people, it being a postmodern phenomenon, and it being a means of counter culture or rebellion.
     Topics that often also come up are capitalism, Marxism, and feminism.
     The major assignments we've had in this class are essays.
     One was about folk music and the group who gathers to play in downtown Blacksburg, one was about downtown Roanoke, and one was about a topic of our choosing.
     For the essay where we chose our own topic I chose to write about gender, the ways we express it, and how popular culture can affect it.
     Usually, class consists of one or two students giving a presentation about that day's reading and then a class discussion about it.
     Right now, people are giving presentations, either by themselves or in pairs, about a topic of their choice and how it relates to popular culture.
     My topic for this was beauty and makeup culture and my classmates have had interesting subjects such as game day culture and the Kardashians.

     About the Teacher
     <h2>

     <h3>
     I can tell that Mr. Michael Saffle is very interested in what he teaches in this class.
     I like that the class is mainly based on conversations and that he cares about what the students say, even if they disagree with him.
     He is very friendly and it is easy to have these deep conversations about complex topics with him.
     He'll sometimes spend time after class continuing the conversation with people, which  shows he does really care, an important quality for a teacher to have.
     He is also great at giving feedback and thoughts on assignments.
     For example, when I sent him my powerpoint and handout for my presentation on beauty and makeup culture, he emailed me back with suggestions on extra points to make and even sent me a video clip he suggested I show.
     This means a lot to me as a student because he didn't need to spend the time giving me more things to talk about, but he did, showing that he cares.
