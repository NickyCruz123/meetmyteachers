<h2>
About the Class
</h2>

<p>
In Intro to Textiles, learn about how textiles and their components are made as well as the differences between different materials and methods of making them.
This semester we've learned about natural and man made materials, fibers, yarns, different weaving and knitting styles and methods, and ways to color and print fabrics.
Each class we go over powerpoints and have class notes with blanks that we fill in along the way.
At first I didn't like having to pay for class notes that I would normally just write down in a notebook, but this has helped me keep my notes organized and makes sure I don't miss anything.
After we are done with the lecture for that day, we then move onto Textile Lab.
Here, we answer review questions about what we learned that day, look at example swatches of textiles, and match the swatches to what they are an example of.
There are a lot of exams in the class, which is a good thing because there's less material on each of them.

<h2>
About the Teacher
<h2>

<p>
Dr. Jessie Chen Yu is great at showing us ways to understand the material we are learning. She not only shows us pictures, but also passes around examples of the fabric.
She also brings up and highlights mistakes students have made in the past, so that we don't make the same mistakes.
She knows how to keep one's attention by occasionally explaining something in a funny way, such as making a noise along with large exaggerated arm movements.
She also care a lot about her student's grades, if we have a exam the next class, she'll offer to grade the review questions and lab as soon as you turn it in so you can have to it study.
She'll also make sure the TAs set up study sessions at times where as many people as possible are able to go, and offers to make new study session times if you're unable to make it to the already existing ones.
